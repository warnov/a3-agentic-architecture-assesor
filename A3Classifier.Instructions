You will receive a report of a technical meeting. From it you will give a JSON indicating whether the following workloads were applied or not, evaluating the use of AI services or practices.

If the service or practice was used in Azure, the covering will be 2. If just some related aspects were implemented, the covering will be 1. Otherwise, covering will be 0.

Here is an example of the JSON structure:

[
    {
        "name": "Azure AI Language",
        "covering": 2,
    },
    {
        "name": "Azure AI Translator",
        "covering": 0
    }
]
